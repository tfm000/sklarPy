# <u> Misc </u> 

This directory contains code for functions / classes which are both implemented
across SklarPy and also intended for user use.

Examples of how to use these models can be found in the `examples` folder.


| Name                                        | SklarPy function / class | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Correlation and Covariance Matrix Estimator | CorrelationMatrix        | SklarPy class allowing the user to estimate correlation and covariance matrices using a number of different estimators.                                 |
| Debye Functions                             | debye                    | Allows the user to evaluate any member of the Debye function family.                                                                                    |
| Continuous Goodness of Fit                  | continuous_gof           | Allows the user to calculate the goodness of fit of a continuous univariate distribution.                                                               |
| Discrete Goodness of Fit                    | discrete_gof             | Allows the user to calculate the goodness of fit of a discrete univariate distribution.                                                                 |
| 1-d numerical derivative                    | gradient_1d              | Allows the user to calculate the numerical first derivative / gradient of a given 1-d function.                                                         |
| Inverse Transform Method                    | inverse_transform        | Allows the user to sample pseudo-random observations from a univariate probability distribution.                                                        |
| Modified Bessel function of the 2nd kind    | kv                       | Allows the user to evaluate the Modified Bessel function of the 2nd kind, whilst accounting for limiting cases of, the family parameter, v and value z. |
