# <u> Utils </u>

Contains utility functions / objects to be used across SklarPy.

All functions / objects specified in this directory are not intended for user 
use, unless they are importable from elsewhere in SklarPy. 
For example, the load function can be imported from sklarpy.__init__ 
and is therefore intended for direct user use.
