# <u> Univariate </u>

This directory contains code for all univariate models implemented in SklarPy.
We implement all univariate distributions implemented in your current version
of scipy.stats, in addition to SklarPy exclusives.

For any / all scipy.stats models, see scipy.stats for specific parameter 
ordering / details.

Our univariate models allow for easy plotting, fitting and evaluation of your 
models.

Examples of how to use these models can be found in the `examples` folder.
