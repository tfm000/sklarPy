# <u> Univariate </u>

This directory contains code for all univariate models implemented in SklarPy.
We implement all univariate distributions implemented in your current version
of scipy.stats, in addition to SklarPy exclusives.

Our univariate models allow for easy plotting, fitting and evaluation of your 
models.

Examples of how to use these models can be found in the `examples` folder.
